  Abstract                 = {Duplicate bug report entries in bug trackers have a negative impact on software maintenance and evolution. This is due, among other factors, to the increased time spent on report analysis and validation, which in some cases takes over 20 min. Therefore, a considerable amount of time is lost in duplicate bug report analysis. In order to understand the possible factors that cause bug report duplication and its impact on software development, this paper presents an exploratory study in which bug tracking data from private and open source projects were analyzed. The results show, for example, that all projects we investigated had duplicate bug reports and a considerable amount of time was wasted by this duplication. Furthermore, features such as project lifetime, staff size, and the number of bug reports do not seem to be significant factors for duplication, while others, such as the submitters’ profile and the number of submitters, do seem to influence the bug report duplication.},

  abstract = {Background. The bug assignment problem is the problem of triaging
	new bug reports to the most qualified developer. The qualified developer
	is the one who has enough knowledge in a specific area that is relevant
	to the reported bug. In recent years, bug triaging has received a
	considerable amount of attention from researchers. In previous work,
	bugs were represented as vectors of terms extracted from the bug
	reports' description. Once the bugs are represented as vectors in
	the terms space, traditional machine learning techniques are employed
	for the bug assignment. Most of the previous algorithms are marred
	by low accuracy values. Aims. This paper formulates the bug assignment
	problem as a classification task, and then examines the impact of
	several term selection approaches on the classification effectiveness.
	Method. Three variants selection methods that are based on the Log
	Odds Ratio (LOR) score are compared against methods that are based
	on the Information Gain (IG) score and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).
	The main difference in the methods that are based on the LOR score
	is in the process of selecting the terms. Results. Term selection
	techniques that are based on the Log Odds Ratio achieved up to 30%
	improvement in the precision and up to 5% higher in recall compared
	to other term selection methods such as Latent Semantic Analysis
	and Information Gain. Conclusions. Experimental results showed that
	the effectiveness of bug assignment methods is directly affected
	by the selected terms that are used in the classification methods.},

  pages = {149-158},
  abstract = {Bug assignment in large software projects is typically a time-consuming
	and tedious task, effective assignment requires that bug triagers
	hold significant contextual information about both the reported bugs
	and the pool of available developers. In this paper, we propose an
	auction-based multiagent mechanism for assigning bugs to developers
	that is intended to minimize backlogs and overall bug lifetime. In
	this approach, developers and triagers are both modeled as intelligent
	software agents working on behalf of individuals in a multiagent
	environment. Upon receiving a bug report, triager agents auction
	off the bug and collect the requests. Developer agents compute their
	bids as a function of the developer's profile, preferences, current
	schedule of assigned bugs, and estimated time-to-fix of the bug.
	This value is then sent to the triager agent for the final decision.
	We use the Eclipse and Firefox bug repositories to validate our approach,
	our studies suggest that the proposed auction-based multiagent mechanism
	can improve the bug assignment process compared to currently practised
	methods. In particular, we found a 16% improvement in the number
	of fixed bugs compared to the historic data, based on a sample size
	of 213,000 bug reports over a period of 6 years.},

  volume = {24},
  pages = {3--33},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {The paper presents an approach to recommend a ranked list of expert
	developers to assist in the implementation of software change requests
	(e.g., bug reports and feature requests). An Information Retrieval
	(IR)-based concept location technique is first used to locate source
	code entities, e.g., files and classes, relevant to a given textual
	description of a change request. The previous commits from version
	control repositories of these entities are then mined for expert
	developers. The role of the IR method in selectively reducing the
	mining space is different from previous approaches that textually
	index past change requests and/or commits. The approach is evaluated
	on change requests from three open-source systems: ArgoUML, Eclipse,
	and KOffice, across a range of accuracy criteria. The results show
	that the overall accuracies of the correctly recommended developers
	are between 47 and 96% for bug reports, and between 43 and 60% for
	feature requests. Moreover, comparison results with two other recommendation
	alternatives show that the presented approach outperforms them with
	a substantial margin. Project leads or developers can use this approach
	in maintenance tasks immediately after the receipt of a change request
	in a free-form text. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},
